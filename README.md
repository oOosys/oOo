#	Welcome to		oOo	coOo	eoOo	...

The FINAL GOAL of a custom  oOo  computer system is to be able to "understand" (preferably in English language formulated) requests similar to what ChatGPT is capable of when providing requested source code of applications or when delivering requested informations. The  oOo  system uses the computer idle time to continously improve the speed of information access and the quality of its responses. 

coOo	eoOo	are names chosen to respectively describe the favorite  Console/Terminal and TextEditor applications used on a custom  oOo  system. 

# WHAT DOES  oOo  REALLY MEAN ?

The symbol/term/word  oOo  represents an idea ... and has many different meanings depending on context with a core meaning very hard to impossible to explain using words. 

oOo  is more a personal attitude towards the way of using of a computer system you have full control about yourself than a system or a programming language or a set of guidelines and conventions it comes with. In other words  oOo  is a free of any constraints way of approaching usage of a computer system.   oOo  assumes that you are ready to spend some of your time with adapting the computer system to your way of thinking instead of spending time with adapting your way of thinking to the by the computer system natively supported languages you need to learn in order to be able to speak to the system using available user interfaces and applications.  oOo is about being ready to **take over full responsibility** of how your computer system is responding to you. In other words it's like avoiding visits to a doctor in case of own health problems after deciding that you yourself and your own behavior are responsible for the health problems you are facing and you are yourself the most competent person on Earth capable of finding out the way out from the experienced disease. 

And ...  oOo  is a nice round looking quite unique character triad expressing oOo's tendency to avoid sharp corners, straight lines and line ends ... so use it as a term/word/symbol if you like it or replace it with what **you** consider to be nice looking. Talking to a computer should be the aesthetics pleasing experience and every time a nice adventure making you happy.
