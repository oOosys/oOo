         20-Jan-1997</FONT></STRONG></P>

         <P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1">For more than 16 years Carl
         Sassenrath has been a leading innovator in the field of
         operating system technology for companies like Hewlett
         Packard, Apple, Amiga, and Commodore. Mr. Sassenrath is best
         known as the architect of the Amiga multitasking OS kernel,
         a fast, efficient system which pioneered the concepts of
         dynamically loadable libraries and devices. </FONT><FONT

         </P>

         <H2>Are You Satisfied?</H2>

         <P>We live in the age of tremendous personal computing
         power. Our desktop systems run <STRONG><EM>hundreds of times
         faster</EM></STRONG> than the large, expensive mainframe
         computers of years past. Yet, what has been the end result
         of this unbelievable power? Are you now satisfied with the
         operation of your system? Does it operate and respond as you
         expect?</P>

         <P>Over the past decade the benefits of increased hardware
         performance have been offset by an excessive growth in the
         size and complexity of the system software. Or perhaps it is
         the opposite -- the driving force behind improving hardware
         performance was to <STRONG><EM>overcome an ever-growing
         ineptitude in software technology.</EM></STRONG> After all,
         how usable would Windows95 be on a 8 MHz computer?</P>

         <H2>The Complexity Problem</H2>

         <P>The developers of modern software don't understand the
         consequences of their bloated systems on their users.
         Operating personal computers now requires us to devote as
         much time to set-up menus, installation programs,
         configuration "wizards", and help databases as we do running
         productive applications. Companies like Microsoft mistakenly
         think that we either have plenty of time to burn or perhaps
         actually enjoy endlessly fooling around with their system.
         </P>

         <P>This mindless attitude seems to manifest itself in every
         aspect of modern software, from the development systems
         needed to create it, to the application libraries (APIs)
         required to interface it, to the operating systems necessary
         to run it. This plague has swept through all aspects of
         computer software -- as is evident when you download a 10MB
         C++ shareware program, install an 80MB OS update, or receive
         a 10 CD-ROM developer's kit.</P>

         <P>Many developers defend their software by arguing: "What
         is the harm with a 10MB program? Don't you know that memory
         is cheap?" What they are really saying is: "So what if it
         takes some time to download. Who cares that it consumes disk
         space and half the RAM. Perhaps configuring it is a little
         too complicated. All right, it does have many useless
         features. But, after all, it has less than a dozen obvious
         bugs, and it will run at least an hour before crashing."
         </P>

         <P>These developers fail to recognize the core problem:
         software complexity. In recent years <STRONG><EM>it has
         become universally acceptable for software technology to be
         absurdly complex.</EM></STRONG> Systems have grown both out
         of control and out of proportion to their benefits, becoming
         wasteful, brittle, clumsy and slow. Like our federal
         government, these complex software systems are now
         perpetuated by thriving bureaucracies of non-thought,
         propelled by their own markets of desperate, inexperienced
         consumers who see no alternatives.</P>

         <H2>Back to the Future</H2>

         <P>I have reached my limit when it comes to "modern"
         software practices. Over the past few years I've been
         dreaming not of the future, but the past. Perhaps you
         remember those days... when a word processor was distributed
         on a single floppy and what seemed like a huge OS took two.
         Remember being wonderfully productive on a 7MHz system with
         a 10MB hard drive? If something went wrong, you felt that
         there was a good chance you could fix it yourself.</P>

         <P>To me this is all about <STRONG><EM>Personal Computing,
         not Personal Enslaving. It is about being the masters of our
         own computers,</EM></STRONG> not the reverse. A decade ago
         this was true, but we are not the masters any more. Is it
         possible to reclaim that position? Or, has it been lost to
         history like the Tucker Automobile? Everyone tells me that
         the world of personal computing is now totally dominated by
         a single system -- one which I believe lacks not only a
         consistent, efficient, reliable architecture, but an
         intelligent vision of the future.</P>

         <P><STRONG><EM>Perhaps we are at a pivotal point in personal
         computing, and this is where we must take our
         stand.</EM></STRONG> It is my sincere hope that there are
         enough scattered outposts of rebels who believe as I do and
         refuse to bow to the "empire" (or have done so under duress
         and seek an opportunity to flee.) With a critical mass we
         can build our own future and return to what Personal
         Computing was meant to be.</P>

         <H2>My Part</H2>

         <P>For years after creating the Amiga's multitasking OS
         architecture <STRONG><EM>I assumed operating systems would
         continue to improve</EM></STRONG>. I figured that with five
         million people using the Amiga and valuing its design, I had
         made my contribution. I set aside my new OS visions, naively
         thinking that others would carry the torch onward toward the
         best possible future. I know now that I made a mistake, and
         I have come to regret it.</P>

         <P>I am now prepared to develop the system that I have been
         contemplating for the last decade. I'm not talking here
         about making a clone of any existing system (including the
         Amiga). What I want is <STRONG><EM>a personal computer that
         I would like to use: </EM></STRONG> a system that is
         genuinely easy-to-operate, consistent, flexible, powerful,
         small, and fast.</P>

         <P>My plan involves two phases. The first phase is the
         completion of <STRONG><EM>a new scripting and control
         language.</EM></STRONG> I have worked on the design of this
         language part-time for many years. Within the last few
         months my efforts have been full-time, and the language is
         nearly ready for its prototype (alpha) release. Versions
         will be available for each of the major platforms over the
         next month.</P>

         <P>Why a language? Because I believe that the core of
         computing is not based on operating system or processor
         technologies but on language capability. Language is both a
         tool of thought and a means of communication. Just as our
         minds are shaped by human language, so are operating systems
         shaped by programming languages. <STRONG><EM>We implement
         what we can express.</EM></STRONG> If it cannot be
         expressed, it will not be implemented.</P>

         <P>Once the language is complete and in distribution, the
         second phase is to develop <STRONG><EM>a small and flexible
         operating system</EM></STRONG> which is integrated in a
         unique way with the language. Attribute settings, control
         scripts, configuration, installation, interprocess
         communications, and distributed processing will be
         facilitated through the language. Applications can still be
         written in C and various other languages, but some aspects
         of their system interface will be done through the OS
         language. This system is slated for prototype release later
         in the year and will be targeted at a few different hardware
         platforms.</P>

         <H2>Your Part</H2>

         <P>The language and system described above are huge projects
         and will require my best efforts for some time to come. This
         is <STRONG><EM>my sole mission</EM></STRONG>, and I have no
         other jobs or contracts to help pay the way. Yet, I have
         absolutely no intention of selling out to a big corporation
         or being driven by Wall Street greed. To do so would be to
         risk losing control (again) to those who lack the insight
         and understanding to make the best decisions in the years
         ahead.</P>

         <P>Instead, my approach is to determine if there are enough
         of you out there who feel as I do -- who want a choice, who
         want a system that makes you the master, and who would be
         willing to help support it through financial contributions.
         </P>

         <P>I've been considering this for many months, but I've
         never done a user-funded project like this before, and I
         don't know what to expect. Right now I am hopeful, but also
         a little nervous. It's a big risk. If you like what I am
         proposing, please take to it to heart and consider what I
         have said, because I cannot do it without you.</P>

         <P><STRONG><EM>It's time to do something different. It's
         time to do something for ourselves. I hope you will join
         with me, rebel against software complexity, and return us
         again to being the masters of our own Personal
         Computing.</EM></STRONG></P>

         <P>Yours as always,</P>
